## Ficbook Parser
A simple, primitive solution for parsing and downloading fanfictions from ficbook.net with GUI.
Unlike ficbook itself, it saves all chapters of a fanfiction as separate txt files instead of a single large file.
Made just for educational purposes, not meant to be taken as a serious software.

### Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ficbookparser_GUI.pyw
```
